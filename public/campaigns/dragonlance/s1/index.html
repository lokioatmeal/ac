            <h3>Session 1: A Fond Farewell</h3>
<p>After a few days' travel, our heroes reach the village of Vogler, being warmly welcomed by the guards at the gate, who inform them that they are
in town just in time for the Kingfisher Festival, set to start tomorrow morning. They make their way into town, soliciting waves and welcomes from
various townsfolk. Upon reaching the town square, they see numerous people setting up stalls, stages, and decorations for the festival tomorrow.</p>
<p>Our heroes wander through the town, eventually reaching The Brass Crab, a local tavern and the venue for tonight's memorial service. As they enter,
they see a mix of folks from all walks of life, indicative of Ispin's various adventures in life, now joined together for his final send-off. As they
survey the room, they are approached by a woman donning Solamnic armor. She introduces herself as Becklin Uth Viharin, Solamic knight, and the friend
of Ispin who sent them the invitation.</p>
<p>She leads the crowd out onto the docks behind the inn. Ispin's body is wrapped in a cloth and set in a small boat moored at the shore. Standing beside
it is Cudgel Ironsmile, another close friend from Ispin's past.</p>
