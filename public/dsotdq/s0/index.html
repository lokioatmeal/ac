<h3>Session 0: Into the Woods</h3>
<p>Our three adventurers find themselves meeting on the road to Vogler. It is not long before they find that they travel with a common purpose: to
attend the funeral of their dearly-departed friend Ispin Greenshield. After a life of debauchery and misadventures (some of it allegedly true), he
died peacefully in his sleep at his home in Vogler. Our company all received the same invitation to his funeral from Becklin uth Viharin, Solamnic
Knight of the Order of the Crown and a partner to Ispin on many of his adventures.</p>

<p>The day before the company was to arrive in Vogler, they found themselves camped in a clearing just off of the main road upon which they were
travelling. Suddenly, they hear the sounds of clashing steel and striking blows all around them as their sight is filled with visions of bodies
covering the ground. Milton Peterman notices that one of the fallen is clutching something against his chest. He feels the urge to reach for it;
but before he can, it flashes in a blinding light and vanishes. The characters awaken, lying on the ground, with no sign of the battle they saw
around them. But they do find their camp to be sacked.</p>
<p>Milton realizes that the item was a medallion bearing the symbol of a bison's head, but cannot recall what it means. He also notices that there is
a trail of debris from their camp leading off through the bushes. As they begin to follow it, Milton finds the medallion he saw in the vision among
their belongings and reaches to pick it up. As his fingertips touch it, it vanishes in another brilliant flash of light. As it disappears, it emits
a massive shockwave that flattens the nearby vegetation. This reveals overgrown ruins nearby. All of the companions feel drawn to the ruins and
they enter together, drawn in by the sound of voice inside.</p>
<p>Looking around the room, Milton realizes that the walls are lines with statues of the Old Gods from before the Cataclysm. He feels drawn to the
statue of Kiri-Jolith, God of War. Transfixed, he sees a glow begin to emanate from the statue as he hears a voice in his head:x</p>
<p><img src="media/kiri-jolith.png" alt="Kiri-Jolith"></p>
<p><em>Be not afraid, my son. I am Kiri-Jolith and I ask you to go forth and be my agent in the material plane. The world is changing and the Gods need</em>
<em>strong warriors to meet it head-on. Will you take up the call?</em></p>
<p>&quot;I will!&quot; says Milton.</p>
<p><em>Very good. Then accept my power and go forth to spread my will.</em></p>
<p>With that, a beam of energy engulfs Milton, embuing him with the power of his newfound patron. As the light fades, the temple begins to crumble
around them. Our adventurers quickly scramble to escape the structure. Turning around as they exit, they see it being swallowed up by the greedy
Earth beneath, leaving no evidence of its existence.</p>
