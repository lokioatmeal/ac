### Session 1: A Fond Farewell

After a few days' travel, our heroes reach the villiage of Vogler, being warmly welcomed by the guards at the gate, who inform them that they are
in town just in time for the Kingfisher Festival, set to start tomorrow morning. They make their way into town, soliciting waves and welcomes from
various townsfolk. Upon reaching the town square, they see numerous people setting up stalls, stages, and decorations for the festival tomorrow.
